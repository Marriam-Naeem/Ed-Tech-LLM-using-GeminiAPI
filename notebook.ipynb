      "## The Enigmatic Allure of the Cat\n",
      "\n",
      "The cat. A creature of contradictions, simultaneously aloof and affectionate, playful and poised, a hunter with a purr that melts the heart. For millennia, cats have captivated humanity, weaving their way into our homes and hearts, their enigmatic nature a source of endless fascination. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike their canine counterparts, cats retain an air of independence, a vestige of their wild ancestry. They are masters of their domain, dictating terms of affection and demanding respect for their boundaries. This independent spirit, often misconstrued as aloofness, is part of the feline mystique. They are not easily won, their love a hard-earned privilege, making their moments of tenderness all the more precious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, beneath the cool exterior lies a playful spirit. A sunbeam becomes a stage, a dangling string an irresistible prey, a cardboard box a fortress of solitude. Their playful antics, a whirlwind of leaps and bounds, remind us of the simple joys of life, urging us to embrace our own inner child. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond their captivating personalities, cats have woven themselves into the tapestry of human history. Revered in ancient Egypt as demigods, feared in medieval Europe as witches' familiars, and celebrated in modern times as beloved companions, their story is intertwined with our own. They have inspired artists and writers, their enigmatic gaze captured in countless masterpieces, their independent spirit echoing in literature and folklore.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a world increasingly dominated by technology and the relentless pace of modern life, cats offer a comforting presence. Their rhythmic purrs have been scientifically proven to lower blood pressure and reduce stress, their presence a soothing balm for the soul. They remind us to slow down, to appreciate the simple pleasures of a warm lap and a gentle caress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cat, a creature of contradictions, a paradox wrapped in fur. They are a constant source of amusement, frustration, and above all, unconditional love. Their presence enriches our lives, reminding us of the beauty in the everyday, the power of independence, and the enduring bond between humans and animals. In their enigmatic gaze, we catch a glimpse of a world beyond our own, a world of instinct and grace, of quiet power and unwavering self-possession. And perhaps, in their unwavering gaze, we see a reflection of something we admire within ourselves. \n",

Change the data type of the date column to \\x91Date\\x92 if it is in \\x91Date/Time\\x92 format. Skip this step if it is already in \\x91Date\\x92 format.\\n    2.

       " Document(page_content='prompt: What is the difference between Business Analyst Vs Data Analyst\\nresponse: While both business analysts and data analysts work with data, they have different focuses and responsibilities. Here are some key distinctions:\\n\\n1. Focus: Business analysts focus on the business side of things, such as business processes, workflows, and strategies. They use data analysis to identify business problems, opportunities, and solutions. Data analysts, on the other hand, focus on the data itself. They collect, process, and analyze data to extract insights and make data-driven decisions.\\n2. Skill set: Business analysts need to have strong communication, problem-solving, and strategic thinking skills, as they often work closely with stakeholders and decision-makers to identify business needs and develop solutions. They also need to have some knowledge of data analysis, such as data visualization and basic statistical analysis. Data analysts, on the other hand, need to have a strong foundation in data analysis and programming skills, such as SQL, Python, etc. They also need to have a good understanding of data visualization and statistical analysis to derive insights from the data.\\n3. Tools: Business analysts typically use tools like spreadsheets, business process modeling software, and business intelligence (BI) tools to analyze data and create reports. Data analysts use more advanced tools like statistical software, programming languages, and database management systems to collect, process, and analyze data.\\n4. Outputs: Business analysts typically produce reports, presentations, and recommendations based on their analysis of the data. Data analysts produce statistical models, visualizations, and reports to help stakeholders understand the data and make informed decisions.\\n\\nI recommend watching this video by Dhaval sir which explained more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sFRpbPKTG4&t=1s', metadata={'source': 'What is the difference between Business Analyst Vs Data Analyst', 'row': 50}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"prompt: Can you state the distinction among the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), PARALLELPERIOD(), and DATEADD() function in Power BI?\\nresponse: Here is the brief explanation.\\n\\nSAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() compares the given period with the exact same period of last year as the name suggests. But it has a limitation like King of the chess board - it can go only compare 1 year backward for a given day, month, week, or quarter. If you want to go backward or forward or if you need to go 3 or 6 months/years/days you need to use DATEADD().\\n\\nDATEADD() is more like the queen of the chessboard. It is very dynamic as it compares a day, month, quarter, year, etc. over any specified no. of time period.\\n\\nPARALLELPERIOD() works exactly like DATEADD() but there is a minor difference. Parallelperiod() does not work dynamically like DATEADD().\\n\\nFor example, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous month's value for dates between 1/5/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare these 12 days with the entire previous month of April 2023 (1/4/2023 - 30/4/2023) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same days (1/4/2023- 12/4/2023).\\n\\nLikewise, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous year's value for dates between 1/1/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare this time period with the entire previous year 2022 (1/1/2022 - 31/12/2022) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same period (1/1/2022- 12/5/2022).\\n\\nRefer this thread for more info: https://discord.com/channels/1090613684163850280/1106528524023648326\", metadata={'source': 'Can you state the distinction among the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), PARALLELPERIOD(), and DATEADD() function in Power BI?', 'row': 51}),\n",
